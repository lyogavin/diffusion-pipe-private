A muscular panda warrior with distinctive black and white fur markings and a flowing red cape executes a dynamic spinning kick. He is barefoot with visible paw pads and wears a traditional black martial arts belt around his waist and red sparring gloves.\n",
    "The sequence shows the panda character, initially with his back partially turned, in the midst of a powerful, high arcing kick with his right leg as his body rotates swiftly. His red cape billows and flows dramatically with the spinning motion. He completes a full spin with fluid movement, then lands solidly on both feet, transitioning smoothly into a fighting stance facing directly towards the viewer, paws defensively raised. The red cape settles gracefully around his shoulders. The background is a consistent, bright magenta.
