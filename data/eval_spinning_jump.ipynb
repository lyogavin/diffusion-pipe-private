The character is a panda warrior with distinctive black and white fur markings around his eyes and body. He wears a flowing red cape that drapes over his shoulders, a black martial arts belt around his waist, and simple dark wrappings or bands around his forearms. He is barefoot with visible paw pads.\n",
    "The action shows the panda character performing a short, crisp jump. He begins in a ready stance, body slightly angled, bends his knees in anticipation, then pushes off the ground with his powerful hind paws. His knees tuck slightly during the ascent, and his arms remain bent and close to his torso in a combat-ready posture, one paw slightly forward, the other back. His red cape flows upward with the jumping motion. After reaching a modest apex, he descends smoothly, extending his legs to prepare for landing, then touches down softly on his paw pads, absorbing the impact with bent knees before returning to his initial ready stance, with the cape settling gracefully around him. The background is a solid, vibrant magenta color, typical of a chroma key setup. The animation is a smooth loop of this jump sequence.'''\n",
