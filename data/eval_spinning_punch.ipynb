He has a strong, muscular build with distinctive black and white fur markings and characteristic panda facial features with dark patches around the eyes. He wears a flowing red cape that drapes over his shoulders, a black martial arts belt around his waist, and red hand wraps or fingerless gloves. He is barefoot with visible paw pads.\n",
    "The panda character stands in a dynamic fighting stance. He executes a repetitive, swift straight punch (jab) with his right arm (viewer's left), which extends directly forward with a slight torso rotation, then retracts smoothly back to his stance. His red cape shifts subtly with the punching motion. His left arm remains bent in a guard position near his chest. This is a classic, looping fighting game punch animation.\n",
    "The background is a solid, vibrant magenta. The overall visual style is that of a 16-bit era arcade fighting game sprite, with clearly defined pixels and limited color palette animation.'''\n",
